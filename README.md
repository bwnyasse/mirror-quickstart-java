Mirror API's Quickstart for Java Mirror Api Emulator
====================================================

This project is a fork of the official [Google Mirror API's Quickstart](https://github.com/googleglass/mirror-quickstart-java).

The goal is to provide a ready quickstart that works with the [Java Mirror API Emulator](https://github.com/MarcosBermudez/java-mirror-api-emulator)


The main deviations from the actual google mirror Api's quickstart are described [here](http://marcosbermudez.github.io/java-mirror-api-emulator/).
